                <p class='personal'>Hello there! My name's <b>Harkeerat Singh</b> (aka <span class='hark'>Hark</span><span class='red'>Red</span>) and I'm a <b>Programmer</b> which I have been doing since <span class='since'>2019</span>. My first programming language that I learnt was <span class='python'>Python</span> which took me an approximate two years to master starting from <span class='basic'>basic syntax</span> to <span class='oop'>object-oriented programming</span>, <span class='tkinter'>tkinter guis</span> and <span class='much'>much more</span>. Programming has not only given me <i class='w'>analytical skills</i> to prepare me for <i class='w'>work environment</i> but has also taught me the <i class='w'>key-concepts of networking</i> and how it can be exploited for <i class='w'>productive work</i>. It has also given me a voice to express myself, about what I feel like, what I really want to be and also the <i class='w'>art of decision making</i>. I <span class='love'>love</span> meeting new people who too have similar interests in programming and would like to work with them on <span class='ambition'>ambitious projects</span> or maybe just <i>befriend them. :)</i>
