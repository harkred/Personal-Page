            <p>Hello there! My name's <b>Harkeerat Singh</b> and I'm a <i>Programmer</i> and I have been doing it since 2019. My first programming language that I learnt was Python which took me an approximate two years to master starting from basic syntax to object-oriented programming, tkinter guis and much more. Programming has not only given me analytical skills to prepare me for work environment but has also taught me the key-concepts of networking and how it can be exploited for productive work. It has also given me a voice to express myself, about what I feel like, what I really want to be and also the art of decision making. I love meeting new people who too have similar interests in programming and would like to work with them on ambitious projects or maybe just befriend them. :)
